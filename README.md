# Interactive image manipulation tool: Supplementary Material

This supplementary material mainly shows several interactive image manipulation demos, as well as the source code.

## 1. Visible watermark removal

 We provide three demos for visible watermark removal, which can be found [here](./watermark).

## 2. Artistic effects

The demos of the black ball, the Y component of the tomato example and the copper ball image can be found [here](./illumination).

## 3. Binary image manipulation

A binary image manipulation example can be found [here](./ShapeManip/demo.mp4).

## 4. Image deformation

The manipulation of the running horse example can be found [here](./imageDeformation/horseManipulation.MOV).


## 5. Image rearrangement

The demo can be found [here](./rearrangement).

## 6. Tree navigation

An example of navigation on a  tree with hudreds of nodes using zooming and panning can be found [here](./tree-navigation/node-selection-zoom.mp4). 

## 7. Data augmentation

50-MNIST and 50-EMNIST data augmentation experiments details can be found [here](./DataAugmentation). 


## 8. Comparison with GIMP

Comparison of GIMP and our method for seven different applications can be found in [this](./CompareWithGIMP) file.

## 9.Combination of our tools and GIMP

The demo of the combination of our tools and GIMP can be found [here](./Combination).

## 10. Runtime

Encoding runtime for a small dataset of different images can be found [here](./executionTimeAnalysis/time-analysis.ipynb).
